# Quizscrape - A search tool
A study in the risks of internet acesss in a education environment.
## Intro
A python webscraper for quiz answers using existing quizlet decks created by professors and students in the past.
With the COVID Pandemic bringing most schooling online, I noticed a much greater level of cheating amoungst my peers
through use of the web. Particularly in the form of searching through Quizlet decks. This project was an experiment 
to see how much data is actually online given a webscraper greatly improves the efficiency of doing so. I do not
intend to use this personally and suggest others not to use this either for the sake of their own education. 
Quizscrape was very effective at categorical memory-based information like biology or history but struggled with 
questions that require interpretation and not simple pattern matching.

## Analysis
Search times are highly dependent on the hardware that the code is run on. Particularly the processor as the program is utilizes multithreading. Faster machines will take around 5-10 seconds but slower machines could take anywhere from 30-60 seconds. This application is written as proof of concept of the combination of academic resources and webscraping rather than a fully functioning marketable application.

This project is far from perfect and most likely wont run unless tinkered with a bit. The github branch history is a mess to say the least but served as a good tool to familiarize myself with github as both a tool for collaboration and project deployment.

I am currently working to bring back the functionality of this code so a easily downloaded demo can be used. (1/25/22)
