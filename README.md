# Quizscrape
A python webscraper for quiz answers using existing quizlet decks created by professors and students in the past.
With the COVID Pandemic bringing most schooling online, I noticed a much greater level of cheating amoungst my peers
through use of the web. This project was an experiment to see how much data is actually online given a webscraper greatly
improves the efficiency of doing so. I do not intend to use this personally and suggest others not to use this either for
the sake of their own education. Quizscrape was very effective at categorical memory-based information like biology or
history but struggled with questions that require interpretation and not simple pattern matching.

This project is far from perfect and most likely wont run unless tinkered with a bit. The github branch history is a mess to say the least but served as a good tool to familiarize my self with github as both a tool for collaboration and project deployment.
